# Modelos_Matematicos
Mathematical models course, Fall  2022, UNAL

This repository contains various mathematical models used to provide solutions to industrial and scientific problems. The tools used in these models vary from linear regression to numerical methods for differential equations. The mentioned problems are as follows: 
* [Introductory problems](https://github.com/jdcarrascali/Modelos_Matematicos/blob/main/Introductory_problems.pdf): Estimation of the number of restaurants in Colombia using linear regression and modeling of craft techniques to desingn the trajectory of a welding arm.
